# Exploiters

The Infection Monkey uses various remote code execution (RCE) exploiters. To our best knowledge, most of these pose no risk to performance or services on victim machines. This documentation serves as a quick introduction to the exploiters currently implemented and the vulnerabilities they use.

You can check out the exploiters' implementation yourself [in the Infection Monkey's GitHub repository](https://github.com/guardicore/monkey/tree/develop/monkey/infection_monkey/exploit).
