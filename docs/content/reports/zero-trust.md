The Guardicore Infection Monkey runs different tests to evaluate your network's adherence to the Zero Trust framework's key components established by Forrester, such as whether you have applied segmentation, verified user identities, enabled encryption and more. Then, the Infection Monkey generates a status report with detailed explanations of security gaps and prescriptive instructions for rectifying them.
